    <p>Innovation in computing require talents from diverse backgrounds. Given the lack of female participation in computer science, we propose to integrate artistic practice, such as choreography design and video production, into educational Robotics. Our goal is to create comput- ing experience that can relate to and engage female students, and to encourage them to use computer science as a tool for self-expression</p>

<h2 id="problem-and-motivation">Problem and Motivation</h2>
<p>In [1], researchers try to answer the question of why so few women participate in the field of science and engineering. According to their study, there exists a strong implicit association of male with science and female with arts. This inspires us to consider integrating artistic practice into computer science education as a way to attract female students into computer science. Given the success of educational Robotics, we asked ourselves a question: can we introduce artistic practice into robotics and teach young girls to use the combination of the two to express themselves? We find a micro:bit- based [2] robot [3] that can perform various body movements. The research questions are:</p>
<h4 id="1-does-this-method-increase-girls-interest-in-computer-science">1) Does this method increase girls’ interest in computer science?</h4>
<h4 id="2-does-this-method-help-them-learn-basic-computer-science-concepts-in-an-effective-way">2) Does this method help them learn basic computer science concepts in an effective way?</h4>

<h2 id="our-approach">Our Approach</h2>
<p>We created a three-day teaching curriculum for middle/high school stu- dents and visited four schools in February and March 2020. These visits mostly are 1 to 1.5 hour after-school sessions, but there was also one school that offered us three one-hour time periods in the morning.</p>

Then we let students team up, decorate their robots and choose a stage design, and then have each team program their robots and create a short film to show an idea or conduct a performance.</h4>

<p>In February and March 2020, we visited four schools including two middle schools and two high schools.</p>

<h4 id="-school-a-has-a-hispanic-student-population-of-83">• School A has a Hispanic student population of 83%,</h4>

<h4 id="-school-c-and-d-have-a-white-student-population-of-about-60-each">• School C and D have a White student population of about 60% each.</h4>

<p>There were some challenges we faced during the outreach programs.</p>

We collected 23 complete sets of pre- and post-teaching surveys, from 10 males and 13 females. These survey questions fall into three categories: demographic questions, questions about whether a student understands basic programming concepts, such as variables, if-else and loops, and questions about their interest in computer science and perception about programming.</h3>
